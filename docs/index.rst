=========================

Release: v\ |version|. (:ref:`Installation <install>`)


image-diet2 is a MIT licensed Django application for removing unnecessary
bytes from image files. It optimizes images without changing their look or
visual quality ("losslessly").

It works on images in JPEG, GIF, PNG or any format with configured a
processing pipeline. Integration with Django's storage system provides a
seamless integration with most thumbnailing apps.
