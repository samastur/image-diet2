Configuration
=============


Default values
--------------

image-diet2 already comes with some default values so you do not have to know
or type everything. It is enough to provide only changes you want to make and
they will either replace previous ones or be added if they are new.

Default configuration file:

.. literalinclude:: ../image_diet/default.yml
